  Hey, I'm Tiger. I live in Denver, Colorado with my pup Niko. I'm currently
  working on a stealth real estate tech startup, <a
  href="https://medium.com/paper-club">running an AI and machine learning study
  group</a>, <a href="/books/top">reading a lot of books</a>, and <a
  href="/images/fanduel-wfbbc.png">building
  models to win sports bets</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I think a lot about what makes people tick, how machine learning will shape
  the future, how to write better software, my health and nutrition,
  and whether or not Bronn will finally get his castle.

  <h5 class="no-anchor">Compressed Knowledge</h5>

  <p>
  I've always had difficulty with information retention, feeling frustrated
  about forgetting concepts I studied hard for after just a few weeks. In early
  2018 I learned about the idea of <a
  href="https://sivers.org/2do">compressed knowledge</a> and immediately
  began to implement it. I started taking notes on anything I read, watched, or listened
  to that I found interesting. You can check these out by running a search query of following the links in
  the header.
  </p>

  <p>
  So far, this tradeoff of consuming less and taking extra time to consolidate
  knowledge has been worth it. It has both a) helped solidify concepts in my
  head as I compose notes, and b) been a much better refresher than Google
  (since everything is in my own words) whenever something rings a bell. I'm
  looking forward to continuing the practice in the future.
