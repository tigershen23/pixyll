  Hey, I'm Tiger. I live in Denver, Colorado with my pup Niko. I'm currently
  working on a stealth real estate tech startup, <a
  href="https://medium.com/paper-club">running a deep learning study
  group</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/b/kQcx8IZb/reading-list">reading a lot of books</a>, and <a
  href="/images/fanduel-wfbbc.png">building
  models to win sports bets</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I think a lot about
  <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">how AI and machine learning will shape
  the future</a>, improving my
  <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality#Instrumental_rationality">
  instrumental rationality</a>,
  <a href="/2017/05/15/its-worth-it/">writing good software</a>,
  my physical and mental health, and whether or not Bronn will finally get his castle.

  <h5 class="no-anchor">Learning Things</h5>

  <p>
  In early 2018 I started this site to help myself think more effectively. I
  spent a lot of time studying, but was frustrated by how
  much and how quickly I ended up forgetting.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most effective techniques I have found have been
  <a href="https://sivers.org/2do">compressed knowledge</a>
  and <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition</a>
  with a bias towards
  <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/">
  narrative and tree sources</a> alongside doses of
  <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-playlist-of-awesome-putting-perceptual-exposure-to-practice/">
  perceptual exposure</a> where appropriate. This site's
  contents heavily reflect this; my notes are organized as
  full-text-searchable webpages, and my full <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> deck is published
  <a href="/anki">here</a> regularly. The tradeoff of consuming less and
  thoroughly understanding more has made my work and study
  orders of magnitude more enjoyable, productive, and fulfilling.
  </p>

  <p>
  While the primary purpose of this site is as a personal reference, it
  also ostensibly functions as a set of recommendations for
  anyone with shared interests, just like the many book lists and Twitter feeds
  I've trolled to find books and articles. The headers at the top
  are a good starting point. My generic star-rating system goes from 1 (waste
  of time) to 5 (legitimately life-changing), with 2 being "average".
  Each tag has its own page with items in descending rating order. If you know
  of some content you think I might enjoy, please shoot me an email!

      "The best thing for being sad," replied Merlin, beginning to puff and
      blow, "is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You
      may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night
      listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you
      may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your
      honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for
      it then -- to learn."
      (T.H. White)
