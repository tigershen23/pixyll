  Hey, I'm Tiger. I live in Denver, Colorado with my pup Niko. I'm currently
  working on a stealth real estate tech startup, <a
  href="https://medium.com/paper-club">running a deep learning study
  group</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/b/kQcx8IZb/reading-list">reading a lot of books</a>, and <a
  href="/images/fanduel-wfbbc.png">building
  models to win sports bets</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I think a lot about
  <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">how AI and machine learning will shape
  the future</a>, improving my
  <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality#Instrumental_rationality">
  instrumental rationality</a>,
  <a href="/2017/05/15/its-worth-it/">writing good software</a>,
  my physical and mental health, and whether or not Bronn will finally get his castle.

  <p>
  In early 2018 I started this site to help myself think more effectively. I
  had spent a lot of time reading and studying, but was frustrated by how
  much I ended up forgetting.
  </p>

  <p>
  As I began making a
  conscious effort to improve information retention, I heard about many different
  methodologies and eventually settled on a few, namely
  <a href="https://sivers.org/2do">compressed knowledge</a>
  and <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition</a>
  with a bias towards
  <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/">
  narrative and tree sources</a>. This site's
  contents heavily reflect this; my notes are organized as
  full-text-searchable webpages, and my full Anki deck is published
  <a href="/anki">here</a> regularly. The tradeoff of consuming a lower volume
  of quality material with an emphasis on thorough understanding has made
  learning, working, and building orders of magnitude more
  enjoyable, productive, and fulfilling.
  </p>

  <p>
  While the primary purpose of this site is as a personal reference, it
  also ostensibly functions as a set of recommendations for
  anyone with shared interests, just like the many book lists and Twitter feeds
  I've trolled to find books and articles. The headers at the top
  are a good starting point. My generic star-rating system goes from 1 (waste
  of time) to 5 (legitimately life-changing in some form), with 3 being average.
  Each tag has its own page with items in descending rating order. If you know
  of some content you think I might enjoy, please shoot me an email!
