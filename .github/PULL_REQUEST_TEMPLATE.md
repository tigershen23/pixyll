## Read this before making a pull request

### There's no need to make a pull request against the original repo!

In fact, unless you've made changes that you think other people could benefit from, you shouldn't make a pull request just to update your blog.

You can publish your copy of Pixyll from your fork using Github Pages, without ever needing to make a pull request. This repository exists as a template, with your own site existing in another repository.
