  <p><em>TL;DR</em>: The human mind sucks. A lot. And it sucks the same way very
awesome. Try to get ahead of that suckiness and (just maybe) take
advantage of it.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<h3 id="ch-0-introduction">Ch 0: Introduction</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The contents of this book should help you re-think what makes people
go and which systemic mistakes they make</li>
  <li><strong>Behavioral economics</strong> constrasts standard economic theory. Standard
economic theory assumes people behave rationally, which is just not
true. So behavioral economics takes their systemic irrational
behaviors and attempts to apply them to the market</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-1-the-truth-about-relativity">Ch 1: The Truth about Relativity</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Humans rarely choose things in absolute terms. We don’t have an
internal value meter that tells us how much things are worth. Rather,
we focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another similar
thing, and estimate value accordingly</em> (1)
    <ul>
      <li><em>Most people don’t know what they want unless they see it in
context</em> (3). Example: TV sizes. Hard to compare unless given a
range of sizes and prices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>We not only tend to compare things with one another but also tend to
focus on comparing things that are easily comparable–and avoid
comparing things that cannot be compared easily.</em> (7). Introducing
“<strong>decoy</strong> Brad Pitt” (slightly uglier Brad Pitt) makes real Brad Pitt
look much more attractive. People try to find small differences and
use those as points of comparison even though they might be
meaningless in the grand scheme of things
    <ul>
      <li>The Economist: when $125 for online subscription and <em>also</em> $125 for
online PLUS print subscription, it makes you ignore the print only
subscription and just compare those two</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>The more we have, the more we want. And the only cure is to break the
cycle of <strong>relativity</strong>.</em> (20)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-2-the-fallacy-of-supply-and-demand">Ch 2: The Fallacy of Supply and Demand</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>As Mark Twain once noted about Tom Sawyer, “Tom had discovered a
great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man covet a
thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.</em>
(26)</li>
  <li><em>The basic idea of <strong>arbitrary coherence</strong> is this: although initial
prices are “arbitrary”, once those prices are established in our minds
they will shape not only present prices but also future prices (this
makes them “coherent”).</em> (27)
    <ul>
      <li>Example: people think about last two digits of social security
number. This anchors them, and is very close to what they
subsequently say they would pay for a certain bottle of wine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Our <strong>first decisions</strong> resonate over a long sequence of decisions. First
impressions are important, whether they involve remembering that our
first DVD player cost much more than such players cost today (and
realizing that, in comparison, the current prices are a steal) or
remembering that gas was once a dollar a gallon, which makes every
trip to the gas station a painful experience.</em> (38)</li>
  <li><em>So you stand behind these people. Another person walks by. He sees
three people standing in line and thinks, “This must be a fantastic
restaurant,” and joins the line. Others join. We call this type of
behavior <strong>herding</strong>.</em> (38)</li>
  <li>Break anchoring by <strong>creating a totally different, non-comparable
experience</strong>. E.g. Starbucks did everything it could to distance
itself in consumers’ minds from Dunkin’ Donuts.</li>
  <li><em>The sensitivity we show to price changes might in fact be largely a
result of our memory for the prices we have paid in the past and our
desire for coherence with our past decisions–not at all a reflection
of our true preferences or our level of demand.</em> (48)</li>
  <li>Even knowing all this stuff isn’t enough to keep you safe! <em>In our
attempts to make sure that we end up with decisions that seem
well-reasoned and thoughtful, we commonly undergo a lot of unnecessary
mental gymnastics and justifications, particularly when the choices
are large and significant.</em> (52)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-3-the-cost-of-zero-cost">Ch 3: The Cost of Zero Cost</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but <strong>when something
is FREE! we forget the downside.</strong> FREE! gives us such an emotional
charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more
valuable than it really is. Why? I think it’s because humans are
intrinsivally afraid of loss. The real allure of FREE! is tied to this
fear. There’s no visible possibility of loss when we choose a FREE!
item (it’s free). But suppose we choose the item that’s not free.
Uh-oh, now there’s a risk of having made a poor decision–the
possibility of a loss. And so, given the choice, we go for what is
free.</em> (60)</li>
  <li>Examples include people choosing free options that are markedly worse
than even 1c or 5c options. E.g. Hershey’s kiss free and truffle 5c.
Truffle is economically a much much better deal.</li>
  <li>Free should be taken advantage of more in business, society, and
politics by savvy folks.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-4-the-cost-of-social-norms">Ch 4: The Cost of Social Norms</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>When we keep <strong>social norms</strong> and <strong>market norms</strong> on their separate
paths, life hums along pretty well.</em> (76)</li>
  <li><strong>Social norms exist outside of money.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>When money was mentioned, the lawyers used market norms and found
the offer lacking, relative to their market salary. When no money
was mentioned they used social norms and were willing to volunteer
their time. Why didn’t they just accept the $30, thinking of
themselves as volunteers who received $30? Because once market norms
enter our considerations, the social norms depart.</em> (78)</li>
      <li><em>The conclusion: no one is offended by a small gift, because even
small gifts keep us in the social exchange world and away from
market norms.</em> (80)
        <ul>
          <li><em>Offering people a gift, even a small one, is sufficient to get
them to help; but mention what the gift cost you, and you will
see the back of them faster than you can say market norms.</em> (81)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Must be very very careful around the edges. Decide which side you want
to play on and stick with it.
    <ul>
      <li><em>When a social norm collides with a market norm, the social norm
goes away for a long time. In other words, social relationships are
not easy to reestablish.</em> (85)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can take advantage of social norms being cheap and effective
    <ul>
      <li><em>Money, as it turns out, is very often the most expensive way to
motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but often more
effective as well.</em> (93)</li>
      <li><em>The point is that while gifts are financially inefficient, they are
an important social lubricant. They help us make friends and create
long-term relationships that can sustain us through the ups and
downs of life. Sometimes, it turns out, a waste of money can be
worth a lot.</em> (97)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-5-the-power-of-a-free-cookie">Ch 5: The Power of a Free Cookie</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>When <strong>price is not a part of the exchange</strong>, we become less selfish
maximizers and start caring more about the welfare of others.</em> (109)
    <ul>
      <li>Experiment: free starburst vs. 1 cent starburst. Free starburst had
a 50% decrease in total demand</li>
      <li><em>Not mentioning prices ushers in social norms, and with these social
norms, we start caring more about others.</em> (112)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-6-the-influence-of-arousal">Ch 6: The Influence of Arousal</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Experiment: ask Berkeley students to answer a set of questions like “would you
have sex with a married woman?”. Ask first to “imagine they are
aroused” and then asked same questions when they are actually aroused.
    <ul>
      <li><em>We all <strong>systematically underpredict the degree to which arousal
completely negates our superego</strong>, and the way emotions can take
control of our behavior.</em> (129)</li>
      <li>Honestly, best strategy to avoid making mistakes is to try not to
get into these situations in the first place (lol who would do that
tho)</li>
      <li>Applies to all other intense emotions as well (anger, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Obvious issue: completely ignores women. How much should that affect
perception of results?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-7-the-problem-of-procrastination-and-self-control">Ch 7: The Problem of Procrastination and Self-Control</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Procrastination</strong>: giving up on long-term goals for immediate
gratification
    <ul>
      <li>Three classes:
        <ul>
          <li>No deadlines had worst grades</li>
          <li>“Set your own deadline” had middle grades</li>
          <li>Strict deadline had best grades</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>But don’t necessarily want to be dictatorial</li>
      <li><strong>Commitment in advance helps to prevent procrastination and help
with self-control</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Especially if you publicize it</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Can also combat by simplification, reducing cognitive overhead to
perform tasks
        <ul>
          <li>Ford had 18,000 different parts that need maintenance at different
intervals. Honda has same number of parts, but buckets them all
into 3 service periods, which is much easier for owners to
remember. Honda got way more cars in for service</li>
          <li><em>Simplification is one mark of real genius</em> (151)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Immediate gratification</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Variable schedule of reinforcement</strong> also works wonders for
motivating people. It is the magic that underlies gambling and
playing the lottery. How much fun would it be to play a slot machine
if you knew in advance that you would always lose nine times before
winning once, and that this sequence would continue for as long as
you played? It would probably be no fun at all!</em> (159)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Self-control and discipline</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>In order to overcome many types of human fallibility, I believe
it’s useful to look for tricks that match immediate, powerful, and
positive reinforcements with the not-so-pleasant steps we have to
take toward our long-term objectivs. For me, beginning a
movie–before I felt any side effects–helped me to sustain the
unpleasantness of the treatment.</em> (164)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-8-the-high-price-of-ownership">Ch 8: The High Price of Ownership</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ownership bias</strong></li>
  <li>Three irrational quirks
    <ul>
      <li>We fall in love with that we already have</li>
      <li>We focus on what we may lose, rather than what we may gain</li>
      <li>We assume other people will see the tranasaction from the same
perspective we do</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Once we change our possessions we have a very hard time going back
down. As I noted earlier, ownership simply changes our perspective.
Suddenly, moving backward to our pre-ownership state is a loss, one
that we cannot abide. And so, while moving up in life, we indulge
ourselves with the fantasy that we can always ratchet ourselves back
if need be; but in reality, we can’t. Downgrading to a smaller home,
for instance, is experienced as a loss, it is psychologically painful,
and we are willing to make all kinds of sacrifices in order to avoid
such losses– even if, in this case, the monthly mortgage sinks the
ship.</em> (177)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Very applicable to you Tiger!</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-9-keeping-doors-open">Ch 9: Keeping Doors Open</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Xiang Yu explained to his troops that without the pots and the ships,
they had no other choice but to fight their way to victory or perish</em>
(183)
    <ul>
      <li>Spoiler alert: they did</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>We have an irrational compulsion to keep doors open. It’s just the
way we’re wired. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to close
them.</em> (194)
    <ul>
      <li>Experiment: multi-armed bandit experiment with three arms.</li>
      <li>When all three options were available all the time, students made
optimal choices and just spammed the highest-return bandit</li>
      <li>But when doors had the chance of closing, they impulsively fought to
keep doors open even though it’s a suboptimal strategy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Deciding between two similar things</strong> is super difficult
    <ul>
      <li><em>What my friend failed to do when focusing on the similarities and
minor differences between two things was to take into account the
consequences of not deciding.</em> (195)</li>
      <li>We don’t take these consequences into account because we just can’t
close doors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-10-the-effect-of-expectations">Ch 10: The Effect of Expectations</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>When we believe beforehand that something will be good, therefore, it
generally will be good–and when we think it wil be bad, it will be
bad.</em> (204)
    <ul>
      <li>Example: two opposing teams’ fans are watching the same play, one
fan clearly sees a foul, the other clearly sees a clean play</li>
      <li><em>We can add small things that sound exotic and fashionable to our
cooking. These ingredients might not make the dish any better in a
blind taste test; but by changing our expectations, they can
effectively influence the taste when we have this pre-knowledge.</em>
(208)</li>
      <li>Coke vs. Pepsi: Pepsi wins in blind taste test, but when people are
informed which is which Coke wins because of superior branding and
marketing</li>
      <li>This creates conflicts
        <ul>
          <li><em>Conflicts generally require a neutral third party–who has not
been tainted with our expectatinos–to set down the rules and
regulations. Of course, accepting the word of a third party is not
easy and not always possible; but when it is possible, it can
yield substantial benefits. And for that reason alone, we must
continue to try.</em> (216)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>We don’t really understand the role expectations play in the way we
experience and evaluate art, literature, drama, architecture, food,
wine–anything, really.</em> (220)
    <ul>
      <li>Famous violinist “sounds better” in a concert hall because that’s
what we’re expecting. If they were just bussing on the street we
wouldn’t really notice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-11-the-power-of-price">Ch 11: The Power of Price</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Placebo</strong> comes from the Latin for “I shall please.” The term was used
in the fourteenth century to refer to sham mourners who were hired to
wail and sob for the deceased at funerals.</em> (228)</li>
  <li><em>In general, two mechanisms shape the expectations that make placebos
work. One is <strong>belief</strong>–our confidence or faith in the drug, the
procedure, or the caregiver. Sometimes just the fact that a doctor or
nurse is paying attention to us and reassuring us not only makes us
feel better but also triggers our internal healing processes. Even a
doctor’s enthusiasm for a particular treatment or procedure may
predispose us toward a positive outcome.</em> (230)</li>
  <li><em>The second mechanism is <strong>conditioning</strong>. Like Pavlov’s famous dogs, the
body builds up expectancy after repeated experiences and releases
various chemicals to prepare us for the future. Suppose you’ve ordered
pizza night after night. When the deliveryman presses the doorbell,
your digestive juices start flowing even before you can smell the pie.
Or suppose that you are snuggled up on the couch with your loved one.
As you’re sitting there staring into a crackling fire, the prospect of
sex releases endorphins, preparing you for what is to come next, and
sending your sense of well-being into the stratosphere.</em> (230)
    <ul>
      <li>Experiment: dummy pain numbing drug “Veladone”. <em>Indeed, that’s what
most of our participants found. Almost all of them reported less
pain when they experienced the electrical shocks under the influence
of Veladone. Very interesting–considering that Veladone was just a
capsule of vitamin C.</em> (234)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Price also influences the placebo effect. A $2.50/dose every patient
felt better. At $0.10/dose only half did.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-12-the-cycle-of-distrust">Ch 12: The Cycle of Distrust</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Public Goods Game</strong> (e.g. fishing)
    <ul>
      <li>Example: four people get $10 each. Whatever they put into the pot is
doubled and then split evenly; if everyone puts in $10, everyone
gets $20 back. But selfish strategy is to not put any money in
yourself and just reap the rewards. But if everyone does this
everyone loses.</li>
      <li><em>When we all cooperate, trust is high and the total value to society
is maximal. But distrust is infectious. When we see people defect by
lying in their advertisements, proposing scams, etc. we start acting
similarly; trust deteriorates, and everybody loses, including the
individuals who initially gained from their selfish act.</em> (256)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Most people and companies miss or ignore the fact that trust is an
important public resource and that losing it can have long-term
negative consequences for everyone involved.</em> (256)</li>
  <li>You slip into bad habits of lying slowly over time</li>
  <li>The Boy Who Cried Wolf: <em>The second, more important moral–one that we
are just beginning to understand–is that trust, once eroded, is very
hard to restore.</em> (264)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch-13-the-context-of-our-character-part-i">Ch 13: The Context of Our Character, Part I</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Annual losses:
    <ul>
      <li>$525 million from robbery</li>
      <li><strong>$600 billion</strong> from employee theft and fraud</li>
      <li><strong>$24 billion</strong> bogus property insurance losses</li>
      <li><strong>$350 billion</strong> in unpaid taxes</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Self-check + shred originals: 36</li>
      <li>Self-check + shred originals + take money yourself instead of being
given: 36</li>
      <li><strong>Yes, we cheat. But we do not take risk into account very well</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>We care about honesty and we want to be honest. The problem is that
our internal honesty monitory is only active when we contemplate big
transgressions, like grabbing an entire box of pens from the
conference hall. For the little transgressions, like taking a single
pen or two pens, we don’t even consider how these actions would
reflect on our honesty and so our superego stays asleep.</em> (276)</li>
  <li>External controls don’t work…see Congress trying to police things.
Always a loophole.</li>
  <li>Students try to remember 10 Commandments before taking the same test
as before: <em>It was not the Commandments themselves that encouraged
honesty, but the mere contemplation of a <strong>moral benchmark</strong> of some
kind.</em> (281)</li>
  <li><em>So we learned that people cheat when they have a chance to do so, but
they don’t cheat as much as they could. Moreover, once they begin
thinking about honesty–whether by recalling the Ten Commandments or
by signing a simple statement–they stop cheating completely. In other
words, when we are removed from any benchmarks of ethical thought, we
tend to stray into dishonesty. Buf if we are reminded of morality at
the moment we are tempted, then wwe are much more likely to be
honest.</em> (286)</li>

<ul>
  <li>Market/social norms again: <strong>people think less about stealing when it
is indirect</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>When we look at the world around us, much of the dishonesty we see
involves cheating that is one step removed from cash. Companies
cheat with their accounting practices; executives cheat by using
backdated stock options; lobbyists cheat by underwriting parties for
politicians; drug companies cheat by sending doctors and their wives
off on posh vacations. To be sure, these people don’t cheat with
cold cash. And that’s my point: cheating is a lot easier when it’s a
step removed from money.</em> (295)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Same experiment as Ch 13 with the test that students could cheat on.
But now, instead of directly getting cash, they get tokens, which they
go to a different table to exchange for cash
    <ul>
      <li><strong>More than double the amount of cheating</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This experiment was on MIT students. <em>The scary thought is that if we
did the experiments with nonmonetary currencies that were not as
immediately convertible into money as tokens, or with individuals who
cared less about their honesty, or with behavior that was not so
publicly observable, we would most likely have found even higher
levels of dishonesty.</em> (303)</li>

<h3 id="ch-15-beer-and-free-lunches">Ch 15: Beer and Free Lunches</h3>

<ul>
  <li>See if order in which people place orders at a restaurant affects
their eventual happiness with the food
    <ul>
      <li><em>Overall, those who made their choices out loud, in the standard way
that food is ordered at restaurants, were not as happy with their
selections as those who made their choices privately, without taking
others’ opinions into consideration.</em> (309)
        <ul>
          <li>Except the first person to place the order–he/she was equally as
happy as the asynchronous order-placers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Standard economics assumes that we are rational–that we know all the
pertinent information about our decisions, that we can calculate the
value of the different options we face, and that we are cognitively
unhindered in weighing the ramifications of each potential choice
[…] the fact that we make mistakes also means that there are ways to
improve our decisions–and therefore that there are opportunities for
“free lunches”.</em> (314)</li>
</ul>
