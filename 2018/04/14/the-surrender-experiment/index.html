  <b>  ★     ★   </b>

  <p><em>TL;DR</em>: The “flow of events” in Michael’s life, and how it was impacted
by his spiritual journey: from living alone in the woods, to success as
a software entrepreneur, to an FBI raid and trial. Fantastic,
well-written story but just wasn’t enough to get me past my (admittedly
deep-seated) initial skepticism.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Soo…Singer credits all of his wild success and happiness to this
concept of <strong>“surrender” – giving up control to life to see where its
flow leads.</strong></li>
  <li>I’m a pretty rational, logical person so this premise automatically
raises from red flags for me. While Singer’s story is fantastic, this
one case study does little to sway my own worldview.
    <ul>
      <li>Clarify – there is certainly merit to not getting caught up in
little (or even big) things, but I don’t see completely ceding
control as the optimal way there. Just don’t worry about things you
can’t control and I think that’s a good place to be.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I felt like many of the examples of “surrender” weren’t exactly that
wild…they <strong>could be reframed less dramatically</strong> as “going out of my
comfort zone for the purposes of growth”.</li>
  <li>I do see the merit in meditation/yoga to clear the mind. I’ve dabbled
in it a bit lately and have noticed an improvement in my thinking. To
me, the <strong>power of clarity of thought</strong> is the more important takeaway
from this book. This leads to an easier life.</li>
  <li>Are my <strong>personal preferences a net negative or a net positive</strong>? Hmm,
something I hadn’t considered before.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="snippets">Snippets</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    It's as though we actually believe that the world around us is
    supposed to manifest in accordance to our own likes and dislikes
    [...] this is an extremely difficult way to live, and it is the
    reason we feel that we are always struggling with life. (4)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    It was overwhelming at times, but I never lost the perspective of
    watching a voice talking inside. It was obvious it wasn't me; it was
    something I was watching. (12)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The sounds were out there, but they seemed so far away from where I
    was seated inside. A **moat of thick peace** allowed nothing to reach
    the citadel of my elevated state. (21)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I knew where thoughts came from, but where did inspiration come
    from? [...] It came spontaneously, in total silence, with no effort
    or commotion. (36)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    [...] the abandonment of reason that belongs only to young hippies
    and crazy people. (42)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I had not done these things -- they had happened to me. In fact, if
    I had not let go of my initial mental resistance, none of them could
    have happened. (54)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    First, you let go of the personal reactions of like and dislike that
    form inside your mind and heart; and second, with the resultant
    sense of clarity, you simply **look** to see what is being asked of you
    by the situation unfolding in front of you. (64)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I clearly remember granting her request solely because the voice in
    my head was so resistant to it. (67)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    There was the logical, thought-driven mind that links together what
    we already know into complex patterns of thought [...] Then there
    was the intuitive, inspiration-driven mind that can look at a
    problem and instantly see a creative solution. (150)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Since I had absolutely no idea what was going on, thinking about it
    wasn't going to help. (221) [This one doesn't make much sense to me]
  </p>
</blockquote>
